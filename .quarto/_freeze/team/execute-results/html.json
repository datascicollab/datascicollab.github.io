Be sure to also check the \"Enforce HTTPS\" box. Afterwards your repository should look like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](resources/images/website_setup.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='setup website hosting' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that in general, your website will be published to a URL like this:\n\n```\nhttps://username.github.io/repository_name/\n```\nIf you have multiple websites published underneath your username or organization, this should still publish fine. This website will be a subdirectory that is named whatever you have named this repository.\n\nIf you've published this website underneath a GitHub organization (not your own personal GitHub profile), then in the above example URL the organization name will be where we've put `username`.\n\nFor more about GitHub pages (including how to personalize your URL) see the GitHub pages documentation here: https://pages.github.com/\n\nSometimes, GitHub page publishing will take a bit of time. You can click on the `Actions` tab in your repository and see if there is a `pages and deployment` action currently running (indicated by a yellow circle next to the action name). If this is the case, you will need to wait until this becomes a green check mark before your GitHub page will be published.\n",
